Instructions to Complete Single-Page Portfolio Setup
===================================================

Your single-page portfolio is almost ready! Just one small manual edit needed:

STEP 1: Add CSS Link
--------------------
Open index.html and find these lines (around line 31-32):

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="additional-styles.css">

Add this line right after them:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="single-page.css">

So it should look like:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="additional-styles.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="single-page.css">


WHAT'S BEEN DONE:
=================

✅ Created new single-page index.html with all sections
✅ Added fixed navigation bar
✅ Implemented smooth scrolling between sections
✅ Updated JavaScript for single-page functionality
